# BOOK-GENRE-PREDICTION-USING-CNN-AND-TRANSFER-LEARNING

Goal of this project is to compare the results of pretrained models like VGG16, Resnet50 using the book cover dataset.

Key Points:
- Utilization of pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19, and RESNET50) for book genre prediction
- Application of transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models and address diverse book cover styles
- Data preprocessing involving image extraction, category selection, and augmentation techniques
- Discussion of model training, evaluation, and results, emphasizing overfitting and accuracy challenges
- Implications of predicting book genres based on cover images
- Insights into the choice of CNN models and their suitability for the project
